  => there can be multiple entry gates

  => parkingSpot can choosen randomly or have a parkingStrategy
  => parkingLot can have multiple levels 

3. If parkingSpot is available, Ticket is generated for particular Vehicle

4. At exitGate cost computation should happen
  => cost computation can multiple strategies like fixes or hourly
